"Neither apiKey nor config.authenticator provided"

What chat said:
- process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is supposed to hold your Stripe secret key.
- On your machine, you probably set it in a .env file or in your system environment variables.
- When your collaborator runs the project, that environment variable doesn’t exist on their computer, so process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is undefined. That’s why Stripe complains

Basically:
when a collaborator pulls, it doens't automatically pull the .env as well
So you have to: manually create the file

You need to put 
"images: {
    domains: ["files.stipe.com"]
  }"
in the "next.config.ts" for the API to work
