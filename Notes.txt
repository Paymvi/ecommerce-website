"Neither apiKey nor config.authenticator provided"

What chat said:
- process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is supposed to hold your Stripe secret key.
- On your machine, you probably set it in a .env file or in your system environment variables.
- When your collaborator runs the project, that environment variable doesn’t exist on their computer, so process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is undefined. That’s why Stripe complains

Basically:
when a collaborator pulls, it doens't automatically pull the .env as well
So you have to: manually create the file

#3
You need to put 
"images: {
    domains: ["files.stipe.com"]
  }"
in the "next.config.ts" for the API to work


#4
In case you need to discard local changes before pulling

git reset --hard
git clean -f
git pull origin main
git clean -f -d

Potential Interview Problem in a React environment:
"How can the manipulation of UI be used to filter a list? Along
with displaying parts of the UI?"

Answer:
"A condition statement can be utilized by comparing the user's input
to the product name/description. However, for proper implementation, 
the casing of each letter needs to be normalized for accurate results."

Why is this important:
"It shows your ability to work with States in a
React environment. As well as your ability to manipulate
the UI to display your desired task."
